            <h1>Why Is Reading Important?</h1>
            <p>From time to time people have wondered why reading is important.  There 
            seems so many other things to do with one's time.  Reading is important 
            for a variety of reasons.  We will look at some of those fundamental 
            reasons below, but it is important to realize that struggling with vital
             reading skills is not a sign of low intelligence.  For example, John 
            Corcoran, who wrote <a href="http://amzn.to/2lvbTi8" target="_blank" onclick="return FIX.track(this);">The Teacher Who Couldn't Read</a>,
             is a very intelligent man.  He graduated from High School and College, 
            became a popular High School teacher and later a successful business man, &#xa0;all without being able to read.  Many highly intelligent people have 
            struggled with reading; although, when properly taught, most people can 
            learn to read easily and quickly.  </p>
            <p>Now, if a man like John Corcoran can succeed without reading, why is 
            reading important?  A person should really read Mr. Corcoran's story to 
            get the feeling of shame, loneliness and fear that he experienced before
             he learned to read.  He was able to succeed in spite of this major 
            handicap because he was a man of intelligence, ability and 
            determination.  But, make no mistake, it was a handicap that made life 
            harder and less enjoyable. <br/></p>

            <h2>Why Is Reading Important?</h2>
            <p>	1.  Reading is fundamental to functioning in today's society.  There 
            are many adults who cannot read well enough to understand the 
            instructions on a medicine bottle.  That is a scary thought  - 
            especially for their children.  Filling out applications becomes 
            impossible without help.  Reading road or warning signs is difficult.  
            Even following a map becomes a chore.   Day-to-day activities that many 
            people take for granted become a source of frustration, anger and fear.</p><p>
                2.  Reading is a vital skill in finding a good job.  Many well-paying 
            jobs require reading as a part of job performance.  There are reports 
            and memos which must be read and responded to.  Poor reading skills 
            increases the amount of time it takes to absorb and react in the 
            workplace.  A person is limited in what they can accomplish without good
             reading and comprehension skills.</p><p>	3.  Reading is important 
            because it <a href="https://www.learn-to-read-prince-george.com/retraining-the-brain.html">develops the mind</a>.  The mind is a muscle.  It needs exercise.
              Understanding the written word is one way the mind grows in its 
            ability.  Teaching young children to read helps them develop their 
            language skills.  It also helps them learn to listen.  Everybody wants 
            to talk, but few can really listen.  Lack of listening skills can result
             in major misunderstandings which can lead to job loss, marriage 
            breakup, and other disasters - small and great.  Reading helps children 
            [and adults] focus on what someone else is communicating.</p><p>
